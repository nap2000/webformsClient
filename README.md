[Smap Webforms](http://www.smap.com.au) 
======

Webforms is based on Enketo Smart Paper (https://enketo.org) and has been extensively modified to work with a Smap Server. The PHP code from from Enketo has been removed and only the Javascript is included.

Follow the latest news about Smap on our [blog](http://blog.smap.com.au) and on twitter [@dgmsot](https://twitter.com/dgmsot).

WebformsClient uses forks of sub projects that we will contribute to:
* [Enketo Core](https://github.com/nap2000/enketo-core) which we contribute back to the Enketo community.
* [Enketo XSLT](https://github.com/MartijnR/enketo-xslt) - used inside this repo

Browser support
---------------
* IE is only supported from version 10 onwards (older versions do not support the required technologies). For performance reasons this browser is not recommended as it has no native XPath Evaluator
* Chrome, Firefox, Safari for both desktop and mobile devices are supported. Chrome is recommended at the moment.
